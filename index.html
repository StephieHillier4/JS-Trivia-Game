        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my Seinfeld Trivia Game! To get started, simply click on
          the "Start Seinfeld Trivia" link. A "bonus questions" button will
          appear and your score tracker will be activated. There are 40
          questions in total, 10 questions on each main character, plus a BONUS
          SECTION. A player has the option to click on the character image to
          generate a question about that particular character up to max of 10
          times per game, then the questions for that character are maxed out.
          Each question will have multiple choice style answers that are worth 5
          points for each correct answer and with each wrong answer, a player
          loses 5 points. Once a player reaches 40 points, they WIN! If a player
          gets more than 4 questions wrong, they LOSE! A player's current score
          and the number of wrong answers they have will show below the "How to
          Play" and "Start Seinfeld Trivia" buttons so it's easy to keep track
          of their progress.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="bonus-container">
        <h2>Bonus Section</h2>
        <p>
          The bonus section allows players to double the points (i.e. 10 points
          instead of 5 points) especially if it's the difference between winning
          and losing or if they just want to test their true knowledge. For
          example, if a player already has 3 wrong answers and 30 points, the
          bonus question will give the player the extra 10 points to win the
          game! There are 4 bonus questions, one on each main character, and the
          player can choose which main character they want to test their
          knowledge on. HOWEVER, there are NO multiple choice answers and should
          a player choose a bonus question and get it wrong they automatically
          LOSE the game! The score tracker will also keep track of how many
          bonus questions a player has left to use.
