        <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my Seinfeld Trivia Game! To get started, simply click on the
        "Start Seinfeld Trivia" link to arrive at the question section. There
        are 40 questions in total plus a BONUS SECTION. Each question will have
        multiple choice style answers that are worth 5 points each and with each
        wrong question, a player loses 5 points. Once you reach 40 points, YOU
        WIN THE GAME! If you get more than 4 wrong questions, YOU LOSE! A
        player's score will show at the bottom of the screen so it's easy to
        keep track of their progress.
      </p>

    <div class="bonus-container">
      <h2>Bonus Section</h2>
      <p>
        The bonus section allows players to double the points (i.e. 10 points
        instead of 5 points) especially if it's the difference between winning
        and losing or if they just want to test their true knowledge. For
        example, if a player already has 3 wrong answers and 30 points, the
        bonus question will give the player the extra 10 points to win the game!
        There are 4 bonus questions, one on each main character, and the player
        can choose which main character they want to test their knowledge on.
        HOWEVER, there are NO multiple choice answers and should a player choose
        a bonus question and get it wrong they automatically LOSE the game!
