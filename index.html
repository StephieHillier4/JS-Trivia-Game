        <p>
          Welcome to my Seinfeld Trivia Game! To get started, simply click on
          the "Start Seinfeld Trivia" link. A "bonus questions" button will appear and your score keeper will be activated. There are 40 questions in total, 10 questions on each main character, plus a BONUS SECTION. A player has the option to click on the character image to generate a question about that particular character up to max of 10 times per game, then the questions for that character are maxed out. Each question will have multiple choice style answers that are worth 5 points for each correct answer and with each wrong answer, a player loses 5 points. Once a player reaches 40 points, they WIN! If a player gets more than 4 questions wrong, they LOSE! A player's score will show below the "How to Play" and "Start Seinfeld Trivia" buttons so it's easy to keep track of their progress.
        </p>

      <div class="bonus-container">
        <h2>Bonus Section</h2>
        <p>
          The bonus section allows players to double the points (i.e. 10 points
          instead of 5 points) especially if it's the difference between winning
          and losing or if they just want to test their true knowledge. For
          example, if a player already has 3 wrong answers and 30 points, the
          bonus question will give the player the extra 10 points to win the
          game! There are 4 bonus questions, one on each main character, and the
          player can choose which main character they want to test their
          knowledge on. HOWEVER, there are NO multiple choice answers and should
          a player choose a bonus question and get it wrong they automatically
          LOSE the game!
